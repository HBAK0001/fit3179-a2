                <p>The 2019 Australian Federal Election was held on 2019/05/18. Up for election were all 151 seats in the House of Representatives,
                    as well as 40 of the 76 senate seats. As a result of this election, the incumbent government remained in power for a third term by securing a
                    majority of the seats in the House of Representatives which can be seen in the heatmap below.</p>
                <p>Using the rest of this page, you can view
                    the election results broken down into a variety of categories. Try clicking a division on the map to the left to view the first preferences and
                    the two-party preferred comparison.
